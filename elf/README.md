# elf
A project starter management CLI

## How to install it?
Currently I don't have a proper installer. But for time being I am using an alternative approach by creating an alias for the entry point.
`alias elf="node ~/works/saadixl/elf/elf.js"`

## How to use ?
- Select `Add new project` to add starter for a new project
 - Insert project name and project key
- Select `Fire up a project` to check the project list
 - Select the project from list to run the corresponding shell script

## Configure the elf
Right now you can only add your `os` name inside the `config.json`. Right now, if you add `osx` or `macos` as `os` then, after creating a new shell script, it will be opened using `nano`.
